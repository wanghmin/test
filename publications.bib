 abstract = {Sewing patterns, the essential blueprints for fabric cutting and tailoring, act as a crucial bridge between design concepts and producible garments. However, existing uni-modal sewing pattern generation models struggle to effectively encode complex design concepts with a multi-modal nature and correlate them with vectorized sewing patterns that possess precise geometric structures and intricate sewing relations. In this work, we propose a novel sewing pattern generation approach Design2GarmentCode based on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), to generate parametric pattern-making programs from multi-modal design concepts. LMM offers an intuitive interface for interpreting diverse design inputs, while pattern-making programs could serve as well-structured and semantically meaningful representations of sewing patterns, and act as a robust bridge connecting the cross-domain pattern-making knowledge embedded in LMMs with vectorized sewing patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can flexibly handle various complex design expressions such as images, textual descriptions, designer sketches, or their combinations, and convert them into size-precise sewing patterns with correct stitches. Compared to previous methods, our approach significantly enhances training efficiency, generation quality, and authoring flexibility.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we tackle an important yet often overlooked question: What is the optimal mesh resolution for cloth simulation, without relying on preliminary simulations? The optimal resolution should be sufficient to capture fine details of all potential wrinkles, while avoiding an unnecessarily high resolution that wastes computational time and memory on excessive vertices. This challenge stems from the complex nature of wrinkle distribution, which varies spatially, temporally, and anisotropically across different orientations. To address this, we propose a method to estimate the optimal cloth mesh resolution, based on two key factors: material stiffness and boundary conditions. 

To determine the influence of material stiffness on wrinkle wavelength and amplitude, we apply the experimental theory presented by Cerda and Mahadevan [2003] to calculate the optimal mesh resolution for cloth fabrics. Similarly, for boundary conditions influencing local wrinkle formation, we use the same scaling law to determine the source resolution for stationary boundary conditions introduced by garment-making techniques such as shirring, folding, stitching, and down-filling, as well as predicted areas accounting for dynamic wrinkles introduced by collision compression caused by human motions. To ensure a smooth transition between different source resolutions, we apply another experimental theory from [Vandeparre et al. 2011] to compute the transition distance. A mesh sizing map is introduced to facilitate smooth transitions, ensuring precision in critical areas while maintaining efficiency in less important regions. Based on these sizing maps, triangular meshes with optimal resolution distribution are generated using Poisson sampling and Delaunay triangulation. The resulting method can not only enhance the realism and precision of cloth simulations but also support diverse application scenarios, making it a versatile solution for complex garment design.},

 abstract = {The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven the development of system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for embedded and mobile systems, which may define the future of next-generation computation. In SoC devices, efficient cloth and deformable body simulations require parallelized, heterogeneous computation across multiple processing units. The key challenge in heterogeneous computation lies in task distribution, which must account for varying inter-task dependencies and communication costs. This paper proposes a novel framework for automated task scheduling to optimize simulation performance by minimizing communication overhead and aligning tasks with the specific strengths of each device. To achieve this, we introduce an efficient scheduling method based on the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) algorithm, adapted for hybrid systems. We model simulation tasks—such as those in iterative methods like Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel—as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). To maximize the parallelism of nonlinear Gauss-Seidel simulation tasks, we present an innovative asynchronous Gauss-Seidel method with specialized data synchronization across units. Additionally, we employ task merging and tailored task-sorting strategies for Gauss-Seidel tasks to achieve an optimal balance between convergence and efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of our framework across various simulations, including XPBD, vertex block descent, and second-order stencil descent, using Apple M-series processors with both CPU and GPU cores. By maximizing computational efficiency and reducing processing times, our method achieves superior simulation frame rates compared to approaches that rely on individual devices in isolation.

@inproceedings{Guo:2025:FPB,
 abstract = {Knots and ties are captivating elements of digital garments and accessories, but they have been notoriously challenging and computationally expensive to model manually. In this paper, we propose a physics-based modeling system for knots and ties using templates. The primary challenge lies in transforming cloth pieces into desired knot and tie configurations in a controllable, penetration-free manner, particularly when interacting with surrounding meshes. To address this, we introduce a pipe-like parametric knot template representation, defined by a Bézier curve as its medial axis and an adaptively adjustable radius for enhanced flexibility and variation. This representation enables customizable knot sizes, shapes, and styles while ensuring intersection-free results through robust collision detection techniques. Using the defined knot template, we present a mapping and penetration-free initialization method to transform selected cloth regions from UV space into the initial 3D knot shape. We further enable quasistatic simulation of knots and their surrounding meshes through a fast and reliable collision handling and simulation scheme. Our experiments demonstrate the system’s effectiveness and efficiency in modeling a wide range of digital knots and ties with diverse styles and shapes, including configurations that were previously impractical to create manually.},
