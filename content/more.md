## [Mathematics for Computer Graphics](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/math_gr.html)

*What math should I learn in order to study computer graphics?* This is perhaps the most common general question that students ask about computer graphics. 

My Ph.D. advisor [Greg Turk](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/) wrote an interesting article on this topic.

## [The mixed class at Zhejiang University](http://www.cis.umassd.edu/~hxu/alink/jclass/mixedclass.html)
I attended the mixed class at Zhejiang University from 1998 to 2002.

The idea behind the mixed class is to create an interdisciplinary environment by bringing together students with art, science, and engineering backgrounds into the same class.

## [Jade Buddha](https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs348b-competition/cs348b-03/)
My very first course project when I was a student at Stanford. I was intrigued with photorealistic rendering back then. 

This course work page is still alive after 20 years.

## [My Hometown, Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou)
Hangzhou, one of China's seven ancient capitals, is renowned for its tea, silk, temples, fine arts, and, above all, [West Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lake). 
The Venetian [Marco Polo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo) (1271 - 1368) once referred to the city as *beyond dispute the finest and the noblest in the world*.

Since 2011, West Lake has been listed as a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site) and described as having *influenced garden design in the rest of China as well as Japan and Korea over the centuries* and reflecting *an idealized fusion between humans and nature*.
