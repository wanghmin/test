abstract: Capillary waves are difficult to simulate due to their fast traveling speed
  and high frequency. In this paper, we propose to approximate capillary wave effects
  by surface compression waves under the SPH framework. To achieve this goal, we present
  a method to convert surface tension energy changes measured from SPH simulation
  into high-frequency density variations. Based on the compression wave propagation
  model, we present an approximate technique to simulate capillary wave propagation
  in a high-frequency particle density field. To address noise issues in wave simulation,
  we develop a simple way to apply the zero pressure condition on free surfaces in
  projection-based incompressible SPH. Our experiment shows that the developed algorithm
  can produce realistic capillary wave effects on both thin liquid features and large
  liquid bodies. Its computational overhead is also small.
summary: Capillary waves are difficult to simulate due to their fast traveling speed
  and high frequency. In this paper, we propose to approximate capillary wave effects
  by surface compression waves under the SPH framework.
