abstract: 'Real-world cloth exhibits complex behaviors when it contacts deformable
  bodies. In this paper, we study how to improve the simulation of cloth-body interactions
  from three perspectives: collision, friction, and air pressure. We propose an efficient
  and robust algorithm to detect the collisions between cloth and deformable bodies,
  using the surface traversal technique. We develop a friction measurement device
  and we use it to capture frictional data from real-world experiments. The derived
  friction model can realistically handle complex friction properties of cloth, including
  anisotropy and nonlinearity. To produce pressure effects caused by the air between
  cloth and deformable bodies, we define an air mass field on the cloth layer and
  we use real-world air permeability data to animate it over time. Our results demonstrate
  the efficiency and accuracy of our system in simulating objects with a three-layer
  structure (i.e., a cloth layer, an air layer, and an inner body layer), such as
  pillows, comforters, down jackets, and stuffed toys.'
