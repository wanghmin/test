abstract: In this paper we present a hybrid approach to reconstruct hair dynamics
  from multi-view video sequences, captured under uncontrolled lighting conditions.
  The key of this method is a refinement approach that combines image-based reconstruction
  techniques with physically based hair simulation. Given an initially reconstructed
  sequence of hair fiber models, we develop a hair dynamics refinement system using
  particle-based simulation and incompressible fluid simulation. The system allows
  us to improve reconstructed hair fiber motions and complete missing fibers caused
  by occlusion or tracking failure. The refined space-time hair dynamics are consistent
  with video inputs and can be also used to generate novel hair animations of different
  hair styles. We validate this method through various real hair examples.
summary: In this paper we present a hybrid approach to reconstruct hair dynamics
  from multi-view video sequences, captured under uncontrolled lighting conditions.
