abstract: 'While the 3D printing technology has become increasingly popular
  in recent years, it suffers from two critical limitations: expensive printing material
  and long printing time. An effective solution is to hollow the 3D model into a shell
  and print the shell by parts. Unfortunately, making shell pieces tightly assembled
  and easy to disassemble seem to be two contradictory conditions, and there exists
  no easy way to satisfy them at the same time yet. In this paper, we present a computational
  system to design an interlocking structure of a partitioned shell model, which uses
  only male and female connectors to lock shell pieces in the assembled configuration.
  Given a mesh segmentation input, our system automatically finds an optimal installation
  plan specifying both the installation order and the installation directions of the
  pieces, and then builds the models of the shell pieces using optimized shell thickness
  and connector sizes. To find the optimal installation plan, we develop simulation-based
  and data-driven metrics, and we incorporate them into an optimal plan search algorithm
  with fast pruning and local optimization strategies. The whole system is automatic,
  except for the shape design of the key piece. The interlocking structure does not
  introduce new gaps on the outer surface, which would become noticeable inevitably
  due to limited printer precision. Our experiment shows that the assembled object
  is strong against separation, yet still easy to disassemble.'
summary: 'W present a computational
