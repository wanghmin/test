abstract: 'Sewing patterns, the essential blueprints for fabric cutting and tailoring,
  act as a crucial bridge between design concepts and producible garments. However,
  existing uni-modal sewing pattern generation models struggle to effectively encode
  complex design concepts with a multi-modal nature and correlate them with vectorized
  sewing patterns that possess precise geometric structures and intricate sewing relations.
  In this work, we propose a novel sewing pattern generation approach Design2GarmentCode
  based on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), to generate parametric pattern-making programs
  from multi-modal design concepts. LMM offers an intuitive interface for interpreting
  diverse design inputs, while pattern-making programs could serve as well-structured
  and semantically meaningful representations of sewing patterns, and act as a robust
  bridge connecting the cross-domain pattern-making knowledge embedded in LMMs with
  vectorized sewing patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
  flexibly handle various complex design expressions such as images, textual descriptions,
  designer sketches, or their combinations, and convert them into size-precise sewing
  patterns with correct stitches. Compared to previous methods, our approach significantly
  enhances training efficiency, generation quality, and authoring flexibility.'
