abstract: Knots and ties are captivating elements of digital garments and accessories,
  but they have been notoriously challenging and computationally expensive to model
  manually. In this paper, we propose a physics-based modeling system for knots and
  ties using templates. The primary challenge lies in transforming cloth pieces into
  desired knot and tie configurations in a controllable, penetration-free manner,
  particularly when interacting with surrounding meshes. To address this, we introduce
  a pipe-like parametric knot template representation, defined by a Bézier curve as
  its medial axis and an adaptively adjustable radius for enhanced flexibility and
  variation. This representation enables customizable knot sizes, shapes, and styles
  while ensuring intersection-free results through robust collision detection techniques.
  Using the defined knot template, we present a mapping and penetration-free initialization
  method to transform selected cloth regions from UV space into the initial 3D knot
  shape. We further enable quasistatic simulation of knots and their surrounding meshes
  through a fast and reliable collision handling and simulation scheme. Our experiments
  demonstrate the system’s effectiveness and efficiency in modeling a wide range of
  digital knots and ties with diverse styles and shapes, including configurations
  that were previously impractical to create manually.
