 abstract = {Knots and ties are captivating elements of digital garments and accessories, but they have been notoriously challenging and computationally expensive to model manually. In this paper, we propose a physics-based modeling system for knots and ties using templates. The primary challenge lies in transforming cloth pieces into desired knot and tie configurations in a controllable, penetration-free manner, particularly when interacting with surrounding meshes. To address this, we introduce a pipe-like parametric knot template representation, defined by a Bézier curve as its medial axis and an adaptively adjustable radius for enhanced flexibility and variation. This representation enables customizable knot sizes, shapes, and styles while ensuring intersection-free results through robust collision detection techniques. Using the defined knot template, we present a mapping and penetration-free initialization method to transform selected cloth regions from UV space into the initial 3D knot shape. We further enable quasistatic simulation of knots and their surrounding meshes through a fast and reliable collision handling and simulation scheme. Our experiments demonstrate the system’s effectiveness and efficiency in modeling a wide range of digital knots and ties with diverse styles and shapes, including configurations that were previously impractical to create manually.},
