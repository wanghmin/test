abstract: 'This paper presents a simulation framework for liquid wetting across porous textiles with anisotropic inner structure. The textile is composed by intersected fibers and forms capillary pores in the void space, which provides an important force to drive the diffusion by capillary action. The influence of the properties of the textile on the wetting process, such as contact angle, hygroscopicity and porosity, is considered into the liquid wetting process in detail. By liquid-textile coupling, the wetting process is simulated through liquid absorption/desorption by fiber and liquid diffusion in the means of inner fiber, intersected fibers and capillary action. The second Fickâ€™s law is used to describe the non-steady wetting process. Based on the SPH method for fluid simulation, this framework can simulate the liquid wetting across the porous textile by dripping single or multiple drops of water. We also demonstrate the wetting process with the influence of different properties of the textile.'
