abstract: We propose a novel approach to reconstruct complete 3D deformable models
  over time by a single depth camera, provided that most parts of the models are observed
  by the camera at least once. The core of this algorithm is based on the assumption
  that the deformation is continuous and predictable in a short temporal interval.
  While the camera can only capture part of a whole surface at any time instant, partial
  surfaces reconstructed from different times are assembled together to form a complete
  3D surface for each time instant, even when the shape is under severe deformation.
  A mesh warping algorithm based on linear mesh deformation is used to align different
  partial surfaces. A volumetric method is then used to combine partial surfaces,
  fix missing holes, and smooth alignment errors. Our experiment shows that this approach
  is able to reconstruct visually plausible 3D surface deformation results with a
  single camera.
summary: We propose a novel approach to reconstruct complete 3D deformable models
  over time by a single depth camera, provided that most parts of the models are observed
  by the camera at least once.
