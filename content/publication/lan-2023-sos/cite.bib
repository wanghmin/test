 abstract = {In this paper, we present a GPU algorithm for finite element hyperelastic simulation. We show that the interior-point method, known to be effective for robust collision resolution, can be coupled with non-Newton procedures and be massively sped up on the GPU. Newton's method has been widely chosen for the interior-point family, which fully solves a linear system at each step. After that, the active set associated with collision/contact constraints is updated. Mimicking this routine using a non-Newton optimization (like gradient descent or ADMM) unfortunately does not deliver expected accelerations. This is because the barrier functions employed in an interior-point method need to be updated at every iteration to strictly confine the search to the feasible region. The associated cost (e.g., per-iteration CCD) quickly overweights the benefit brought by the GPU, and a new parallelism modality is needed. Our algorithm is inspired by the domain decomposition method and designed to move interior-point-related computations to local domains as much as possible. We minimize the size of each domain (i.e., a stencil) by restricting it to a single element, so as to fully exploit the capacity of modern GPUs. The stencil-level results are integrated into a global update using a novel hybrid sweep scheme. Our algorithm is locally second-order offering better convergence. It enables simulation acceleration of up to two orders over its CPU counterpart. We demonstrate the scalability, robustness, efficiency, and quality of our algorithm in a variety of simulation scenarios with complex and detailed collision geometries.},
